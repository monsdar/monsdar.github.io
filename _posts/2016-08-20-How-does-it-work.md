title: How does it work?
---

Fitznet is basically just a way of transporting ergometer data from its source to applications that could work with that data.

It doesn't matter where the data is coming from, it could be generated by a treadmill or a rowing machine. It's also possible that the data is completely generated by the computer.

On the other side there are thousands of possibilities to work with the data: Show multiple ergometers in a 3D world, gather training data, record the data and replay everything later. It's also possible to share the data via network and train against other humans around the world.
