Currently we're working with 2 developers on creating the basics of Fitznet. Just recently we got our first prototype running:
It was possible to row on my Concept2 rowing ergometer alongside with 4 computer generated rowers. All the boats were visualized on an endless 3D-river.

### FitzLane
This component manages the different trainees. The following trainee-types are usable at the momemnt:

* **C2Connector** let's you connect one or more Concept2 rowing ergometers with PM3, PM4 or PM5 monitors. We're currently testing this with a PM5-based ergometer we have available.
* **BotConstant** is a computer generated rowing bot that row with a constant pace.

One of the main goals of FitzLane was to be easily extendable. It's very easy to create new kind of ergometer connections or computer generated trainees.

### FitzWorld
FitzWorld is an endless generic 3D-world. We created a Template that could be used by anyone to get the basics of Fitznet into Unity.
Our own Unity-implementation of FitzWorld is called FitzWorld_Kennel. It allows for 5 rowers to compete against each other on an endless river.
