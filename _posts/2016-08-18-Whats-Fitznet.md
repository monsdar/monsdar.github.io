title: What's Fitznet?
---

Fitznet is a project to connect fitness equipment like bike and rowing ergometers or treadmills.

* Imagine running alongside other people in the gym on a treadmill - Every treadmill publishes its information to a central big display where you can see each other running through New York
* Think about sitting on a bike ergometer at home driving the Tour de France while Fitznet gets real-time data from the athletes.
* How about riding a rowing ergometer while a bunch of intelligent computer opponents give you a good hard exercise?

The current status of Fitznet is early alpha. We're working on getting the basics. If you're interested feel free to contribute - Fitznet is Open Source software!

Here's a short video showing our current state of rowing visualization:
