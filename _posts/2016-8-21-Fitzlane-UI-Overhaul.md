title: Fitzlane UI overhaul
---

So far we were working with a UI-prototype of Fitzlane. It wasn't important how the application looked, our priority was to get all the features running we wanted in there. In the last days we made lot of progress, the only thing that prohibited us from showing FitzLane was the ugly UI. So today I sat down and did a complete overhaul. See the rest of the post for some screenshots.

Here's a picture of the old UI:

Here's the result:

FitzLane is still far from being finished, the current UI probably won't last long. But at least it's possible to show it around now.
