title: What's Fitznet?
permalink: /overview/
---

Fitznet is a project to connect fitness equipment like bike and rowing ergometers or treadmills.

* Imagine running alongside other people in the gym on a treadmill - Every treadmill publishes its information to a central big display where you can see each other running through New York.
* Think about sitting on a bike ergometer at home driving the Tour de France while Fitznet gets real-time data from the athletes.
* How about riding a rowing ergometer while a bunch of intelligent computer opponents give you a good hard exercise?
* All of this is interconnectable: You can have a 3D world where rowers row on a lake while runners run on the shore.

The current status of Fitznet is early alpha. We're currently working on the basics. If you're interested feel free to contribute - Fitznet is Open Source software!

Here's a short video showing our current state of rowing visualization:

### How does it work?
Fitznet is basically just a way of transporting ergometer data from its source to applications that could work with that data.

It doesn't matter where the data is coming from, it could be generated by a treadmill or a rowing machine. It's also possible that the data is completely generated by the computer.

On the other side there are thousands of possibilities to work with the data: Show multiple ergometers in a 3D world, gather training data, record the data and replay everything later. It's also possible to share the data via network and train against other humans around the world.
